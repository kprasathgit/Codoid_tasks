//Implement a program for encapsulation
      // Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data(variables) and code(methods) together as a single unit. 
      //Here, the data is hidden from the outer world and can be accessed only via current class methods. 
      //This helps in protecting the data from any unnecessary modification.. 
       //We can achieve encapsulation in Java by: Declaring the variables of a class as private.


import java.util.Scanner;
class Encapsulation {

	private double salary;
	private double bonus;

	// constructor assigns from local to global variable
	public Encapsulation(double basesalary, int noOfProjectsCompleted) {

		this.salary = basesalary;

		// if project completed is more than then 10 bonus will be 20% of base salary
		if (noOfProjectsCompleted >= 10) {
			this.bonus = salary * 0.20;

		// if project completed is between 1 to 9 then bonus will be 10% of base salary
		} else if (noOfProjectsCompleted >= 1 && noOfProjectsCompleted <= 9) {
			this.bonus = salary * 0.10;

		// otherwise no bonus
		} else
			this.bonus = basesalary;
